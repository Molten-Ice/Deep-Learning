It is clear from the forecasts made by TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group that the cost of trying to influence the 2008 election will be significantly higher than before and will bring about some interesting changes. It will be interesting to see how this affects the election and whether or not it ultimately leads to more informed voters.\n",

The metaphor of \"lighting a candle\" serves as a symbol of positivity; that in the face of darkness and adversity, a single spark of hope can bring about change. By focusing on the possibilities of the future, Kennedy underscores the importance of optimism despite any challenges that may arise. His words reflect the author's view that hope is a powerful tool and that it can be leveraged to spark progress and bring positive change to the world.\n"
